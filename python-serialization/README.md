Tasks
0. Basic Serialization
mandatory
Create a basic serialization module that adds the functionality to serialize a Python dictionary to a JSON file and deserialize the JSON file to recreate the Python Dictionary.

Instructions:
Write a Python module named task_00_basic_serialization.py with the following functions:

def serialize_and_save_to_file(data, filename):
    # Your code here to serialize and save data to the specified file
    pass

def load_and_deserialize(filename):
    # Your code here to load and deserialize data from the specified file
    pass
The function serialize_and_save_to_file take 2 parameters:

data: A Python Dictionary with data
filename: The filename of the output JSON file If the output file already exists it should be replaced.
The function load_and_deserialize take 1 parameters:

filename: The filename of the input JSON file This function returns a Python Dictionary with the deseialized JSON data from the file.
Execution Output Example:


1. Pickling Custom Classes
mandatory
Learn how to serialize and deserialize custom Python objects using the pickle module.

Instructions:
Create a custom Python class named CustomObject. This class should have the following attributes:
name (a string)
age (an integer)
is_student (a boolean)
Additionally, the class should have a method display method to print out the object’s attributes with the following format:

Name: John
Age: 25
Is Student: True
Implement two methods within this class:
serialize(self, filename): This method will take a filename as its parameter. Using the pickle module, it will serialize the current instance of the object and save it to the provided filename.
@classmethod deserialize(cls, filename): This class method will take a filename as its parameter. Using the pickle module, it will load and return an instance of the CustomObject from the provided filename.
Save your code in a file named task_01_pickle.py.
Make sure to handle possible exceptions for non-existent or malformed files. If this happens, the methods should return None

2. Converting CSV Data to JSON Format
mandatory
The objective of this exercise is to gain experience in reading data from one format (CSV) and converting it into another format (JSON) using serialization techniques.

Instructions:
Begin by importing the required modules: python import csv import json

Define a function named convert_csv_to_json that takes the CSV filename as its parameter and writes the JSON data to data.json.

Inside this function:

Use Python’s csv module to open the CSV file and read the data. Use the DictReader class to convert each row into a dictionary.
Serialize the list of dictionaries using the json module.
Write the serialized JSON data to data.json.
The function should return True if the conversion was successful.

Handle exceptions, such as file not found. Function should return False in this case.

Save your work in task_02_csv.py.

3. Serializing and Deserializing with XML
mandatory
In this exercise we’ll explore serialization and deserialization using XML as an alternative format to JSON.

Instructions:
Begin by importing the required modules. You can use the xml.etree.ElementTree module which is a part of Python’s standard library for XML processing:
   import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET
Define two main functions:
serialize_to_xml(dictionary, filename): This will take a Python dictionary and a filename as parameters. It should serialize the dictionary into XML and save it to the given filename.

deserialize_from_xml(filename): This will take a filename as its parameter, read the XML data from that file, and return a deserialized Python dictionary.

For serialize_to_xml:
Create a root element, e.g., <data>.
Iterate through the dictionary items and add them as child elements to the root.
Write the XML tree to the provided filename using the ET.ElementTree class.
For deserialize_from_xml:
Parse the XML file using ET.parse.
Navigate through the XML elements to reconstruct the dictionary.
Return the constructed dictionary.
Be cautious about data types. XML doesn’t differentiate between numbers and strings, etc., like Python does. You might need to manage type conversions.

Save your work in 03-xml.py.
